## Papers ðŸ““

### **Timetable Scheduling for the Department of Data Science and Knowledge Engineering**
25/06/2020

In this paper, we investigate whether ILP and metaheuristic approaches could be applied to generate timetables for the Department of Data Science andKnowledge Engineering (DKE) at Maastricht University, and improve them in terms of  student satisfiability.

### **NLP approach to Annual Reports Analysis**
27/05/2020

The aim of this paper is to make use of text mining and NLP methods in order to extract relevant information about changes in a company, such as people, new products or stores, from its annual reports as well as extracting the general sentiment of these texts.

### **Evolutionary Robotics Simulator - Dust collecting robot**
15/03/2020

This paper presents a solution to the dust collecting robot problem. To train the robot, a 2D simulator was created (with collisions, basic physics and several environments) and then trained with an evolutionary algorithm on a neural network.

### **Improved algorithm selection in the hyper-agent approach to General Video Game Playing**
22/01/2020

This research project attempts to further the research along the lines of the hyper-agent approach in General Video Game Playing. It is part of a research project for the Master in Artificial Intelligence at the Maastricht University. [Link to full text](papers/MRP_HyperAgent.pdf)

### **Automatic evaluation plug-in for Moodle** 
05/07/2019

This project presents a tool for the automatic evaluation of programming exercises integrated in the Moodle platform. It is part of my final thesis for the Computer Science Engineering Degree at the University of Cantabria and it was presented at the JENUI 2019 congress.

## Articles ðŸ“°
### **Is it worth it to build a home cluster?** ðŸ–¥ðŸ§®
11/01/2020

The internet is full of people creating their own custom cluster computers at home, but nowadays there are available powerful web services like Azure, AWS or Google Cloud on which we can run parallel programs, train CNNs, host web applications or anything we want, so... Is it worth it to create a home cluster from scratch instead of using these alternatives?

### **Hyperinflation in videogames** ðŸ’¸
28/08/2019

What is hyperinflation? How does it appear in videogames? What are the best solutions to avoid it in your games? [Continue reading...](articles/hyperinflation_in_videogames.md)


## Game dev ðŸŽ®

### Andantino aplha-beta AI approach
27/10/2019

It consists in the creation of a Game Engine for a two-player board game called Andantino, and the implementation of several AI approaches to see which one performs better. The program is based on the alpha-beta framework. [Detailed DEVLOG](gamedev/andantino.md) - [Results report](papers/Andantino_Report_GuillermoQuintana.pdf)

### Anachrony
I'm currently trying to make a **Real Time Strategy game** using Unity 3D and Blender. Here you have the detailed ðŸ‘‰[DEVLOG](gamedev/RTSdevlog.md).

### Collapsing choice
29/09/2019

This is a web game I made in 24h. You have to decide what to eradicate from existence between two concepts every round, the decisions are more hard over time. You can play the game [here](gamedev/collapsing_choice/index.html). And [here](gamedev/collapsing_choice.md) is the complete devlog of the 24h of development.
