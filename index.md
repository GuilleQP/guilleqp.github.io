## Game dev ðŸŽ®

### Andantino aplha-beta AI approach
27/10/2019

It consists in the creation of a Game Engine for a two-player board game called Andantino, and the implementation of several AI approaches to see which one performs better. The program is based on the alpha-beta framework. [Detailed DEVLOG](gamedev/andantino.md) - [Results report](papers/Andantino_Report_GuillermoQuintana.pdf)

### Anachrony
I'm currently trying to make a **Real Time Strategy game** using Unity 3D and Blender. Here you have the detailed ðŸ‘‰[DEVLOG](gamedev/RTSdevlog.md).

### Collapsing choice
29/09/2019

This is a web game I made in 24h. You have to decide what to eradicate from existence between two concepts every round, the decisions are more hard over time. You can play the game [here](gamedev/collapsing_choice/index.html). And [here](gamedev/collapsing_choice.md) is the complete devlog of the 24h of development.
